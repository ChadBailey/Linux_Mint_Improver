# Linux_Mint_Improver
This project is intended to "improve" a base install of Linux Mint. This is just an easy way to say apply my preferred customizations - I do not think [all of] these "improvements" are actually improvements or even belong in the default loadout of Linux Mint, I'm just really bad at coming up with names.
